    @category    BNZHex
    @abstract    Adds support to NSData for reading and writing hexadecimal 
                 strings.
    @discussion  This category allows the conversion of NSData objects to and
                 from NSStrings containing hexadecimal characters.
 
                 When converting from an NSString, it is assumed that the 
                 string does not begin with '0x', and does not contain any
                 special formatting, such as spaces or dashes. Invalid 
                 characters are considered equivilent to 0x0. In the event the 
                 string does not contain an even number of characters, an extra 
				 0x0 will be prepended to the string so that the binary 
				 equivilent representation fits within byte boundaries.
 
				 Likewise, when when converting to an NSString, no special 
				 formatting will be applied. If this is desired, you may want 
				 to instead use the [NSData description] method.
